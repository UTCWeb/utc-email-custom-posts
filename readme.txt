# How to compose and send newsletters

Newsletters are WordPress custom posts with templates that are optimized for display and delivery to email clients. Because there are so many clients on so many different devices, the templates and styles are very simple and limited.
Tips for newsletter content:

    - Use basic text styles such as Headings, paragraphs, lists, and hyperlinks.
    - Separate sections with a horizontal rule line.
    - For images, use full-width, horizontal/landscape images. Choose “Medium Large 610px” style; do not align images. Image captions may be used.

## To create a newsletter:

- Hover or click the + New menu item and click Newsletter
- Add a Classic block to the content area (just begin typing "/class" and it'll appear for selection)
- In the Newsletter tab, under Templates, select the Image Header template, Default template, or E-News Digest template
- Use the WordPress visual editor to compose a simple post with text and images
- Publish or Update the newsletter, then click View Newsletter on the "Page updated" message that appears in the editor
